    <h2>Tahzoo + Tridion + Node</h2>
    <p>Tahzoo has done two Tridion implementations that involved node.js in a significant way.</p>
    <p>One implementation was Web 8.5, DXA 1.6, and Node had a serious role to play in the front-end</p>
    <p>Another implementation was Web 8.1, DXA 1.6, and Node had a serious role to play in the back-end.</p>
    <p>We've also seen another implementation where Node was both back-end and front-end. </p>
