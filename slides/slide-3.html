<h2>What can Node do?</h2>
<ul data-fx="fadein">
<li ><code>header</code> and <code>footer</code> can be embedded schemas</li>
<li><code>figure</code> can be a multimedia schema &mdash; embedded or content</li>
<li><code>aside</code> can be a single unit of content, or a collection of content, that isn't directly related to the stuff nearby. This is ideal for user targetted content. </li>
<li><code>nav</code> can be any collection of link lists</li>
<li><code>section</code> can be any component that contains component links</li>
</ul>
<h2>It's about relationships</h2>
<p>A single unit of content can stand on its own, but it can still have a relationship to other pieces of content on the page. </p>
<p>Teach content authors about these semantic containers so that they can form meaningful relationships between blocks of content. </p>
