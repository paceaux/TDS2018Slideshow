    <p>Backend developers are, of course, using NPM. But they're also writing JavaScript that's meant to get executed by Node. Of course, any number of packages may be used, but the following may be the most popular</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Rollup</dt><dd>Module Bundler known for "tree shaking" (removing unused dependencies). Used for generation NPM modules </dd>
        <dt>TypeScript</dt><dd>Type checking for JavaScript. </dd>
        <dt>Bluebird</dt><dd>Promise Library. Extremely popular before Node got promises of its own. </dd>
        <dt>Express</dt><dd>Web Application Framework. Robust and feature rich, with built-in templating options </dd>
        <dt>Koa</dt><dd>Web application framework. The lightweight, "spiritual successor" to Express</dd>
