    <h3>Node in the front-end</h3>
    
    <p>Front-end Developers aren't using Node that much, but they live by its package manager, NPM. Front end developers are relying on a plethora of NPM modules for delivering software. </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Grunt</dt><dd>Configuration based task running.</dd> <dd>Popular in 4-year-old repositories and SDL.</dd>
        <dt>Gulp</dt><dd>Stream-based task running.</dd><dd>Popular with our parents.</dd>
        <dt>Webpack</dt><dd>Module Bundler</dd><dd>The hippest way to build something for the browser.</dd>
        <dt>NPM Scripts</dt><dd>Scripts written in a package.json to be executed by command line</dd><dd>The neo-hipster way to run builds and tasks </dd>
        <dt>Babel</dt><dd>JavaScript transpiler. Guarantees your ES6++ works in all browsers</dd>
        <dt>ESLint</dt><dd>"linting" utility that evaluates code for formatting and consistency.</dd>
        <dt>Angular</dt><dd>TypeScript-powered MVW framework with 2-way data-binding</dd><dd>Not hipster because Google backs it.</dd>
        <dt>React</dt><dd>State-based, data-binding, shadow-DOM diffing, MV* <s>templating</s> <s>framework</s> library</dd><dd>Most hipster because Facebook backs it.</dd>
        <dt>Vue</dt><dd>State-based, data-binding, MVVM  framework  </dd><dd>Punk. Created by a Google employee who wanted Angular to be like React.</dd>
        <dt>Jade</dt><dd>Templating framework made for people who wanted HTML to be more like Python.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>It's bad, guys. Really bad.</p>

    <h3>Node in the back-end</h3>
    <p>With 700,000 NPM packages, it's hard to say what goes into a Node-based web application.</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Rollup</dt><dd>Module Bundler known for "tree shaking" (removing unused dependencies). Used for generation NPM modules. Popular with people that don't want an NPM module to have the density of a dying star. </dd>
        <dt>TypeScript</dt><dd>Type checking for JavaScript. Popular with people afraid of JavaScript.</dd>
        <dt>Bluebird</dt><dd>Promise Library. Extremely popular before Node got native promises. </dd>
        <dt>Express</dt><dd>Web Application Framework. Robust and feature rich, with built-in templating options. </dd>
        <dt>Koa</dt><dd>Web application framework. The lightweight, "spiritual successor" to Express.</dd>
        <dt>GraphQL</dt><dd>Query language and runtime for data. Hipster, because Facebook built it. Not hipster, because SDL uses it.</dd>
        <dt>Lodash</dt><dd>Utility library that makes it easier to deal with data. Becoming less popular because of ES6++ </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>It's not as bad here. But it ain't great. </p>

    <h3>Testing in Node</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>Test Frameworks (food)</dt>
        <dd>Mocha</dd>
        <dd>Jasmine</dd>
        <dd>Cucumber</dd>
        <dt>Assertion Frameworks</dt>
        <dd>Chai</dd>
        <dd>Jest</dd>
        <dt>Browser emulators (supernatural)</dt>
        <dd>Nightwatch</dd>
        <dd>Phantom</dd>
        <dd>Casper</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Apparently developers get scared and hungry when it's time for testing</p>

    <h3>Creating Apps</h3>
    <dl>
        <dt>React Native</dt><dd>It's React, but builds native mobile apps. Compiles to Objective-C or Java.</dd>
        <dt>Electron</dt><dd>Builds cross-platform desktop apps. (Visual Studio Code and Slack are both Electron apps)</dd>
        <dt>NativeScript</dt><dd>Builds native mobile apps from Angular, Vue, TypeScript, or vanilla JavaScript. </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>Probably the most intriguing aspect of the Node ecosystem is that it's now possible to generate <em>Native applications</em> from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</p>
