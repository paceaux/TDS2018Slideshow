    <h3>Node was a solution to a concurrency problem</h3>

    <p>Ryan Dahl created node.js to solve a concurrency problem<sup>1</sup>. He wanted the server to send messages without the client needing to request them every time.</p>

    <p>It only seemed sensible to borrow the V8 engine that the Google team made for Chrome. A JavaScript runtime compiler is the perfect solution to an asynchronicity problem.</p>

    <p>Node's power is in the "Event Loop". Everything happens inside of Node is a reaction to an event that's managed within that event loop<sup>2</sup>. <span data-fx="highlight">The event loop is what allows Node to handle I/O on a single thread. </span> </p>

    <h3>Node is a nine-year-old</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Node got a name in March of 2009, which was six months to the day after the first release of Chrome.<sup>3</sup></li>
        <li>NPM showed up 7 months later<sup>4</sup>.</li>
        <li>Express.js' first version came a year after Node.</li>
        <li>In 2017 alone NPM had over 350,000 packages; the largest package registry in the world<sup>5</sup></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Node is young but it's growing up fast. </h3>
    <p data-fx="highlight">Netflix, PayPal, Uber, and Walmart didn't start using Node because they're hipsters. They started using Node because it solved the problem of how to get a single thread to handle thousands of concurrent requests.</p>
