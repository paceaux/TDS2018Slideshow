    <h2>Story Time</h2>
    <ul>
        <li data-fx="fadein">It's a B2B project; our client has a few websites available in dozens of language </li>
        <li data-fx="fadein">Client has multiple sites in multiple languages with same brand, different layouts </li>
        <li data-fx="fadein">Client's main sites were already using DXA</li>
        <li data-fx="fadein">Client has content that is displayed in screens in on-site facilities; not strictly "web content"</li>
        <li data-fx="fadein">The content stored in the CMS will have variables. Those variables will get resolved in an application which manages the on-site displays</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="slide__content">
    <h2>An Architecture that we tried</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We would use DXA TBBs in Tridion</li>
        <li>We would build a Rest API in Node.js that provided content</li>
        <li>A third party would be responsible for managing the screen displays</li>
        <li>But we had to build a site preview that showed what content would look like in those displays</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Motivations</h3>
    <p data-fx="fadein"></p>
    <p data-fx="fadein">This wasn't browser content, client didn't need a web app</p>
    <p data-fx="fadein">The client needed an API for another application</p>
    <p data-fx="fadein">The client suggested node.js because it would appeal to their skillsets </p>
</div>
<div class="slide__content">
    <h3>Building a Rest API with node</h3>
    <p>This is kind of node's bread and butter here. Node loves it some Rest APIs</p>
    <p>We created a facade for the OData microservices. Instead of OData requests, we made much more routed API requests. All using GET. </p>
