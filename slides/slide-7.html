<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Except that it has to call the OData (micro-services) directly... and manually handle everything... BUT, if you did reverse engineer and duplicate the Tridion libraries and create Node compatible one . . . that would be AWESOME!</p>
<p>It's all totally possible, and would be a SMART thing to prevent from every single api working with raw OData responses, etc...</p>
<p>Yeah... the Tridion API has additional methods that use other endpoints -- that have to be done just right with encoding, syntax, etc.  Such as the Metadata search endpoint.</p>
<p>because I want to make the point that the idea of a content-api is a good idea with node. But it's still just a layer (fa√ßade) over Odata. So you accomplish a goal of creating a service that works easier for applications </p>
<p>BAD thing that Sodexo did was "assume" that just because DXA is provided that there are no risks of bugs -- or serious-server-stability-crashing-bugs....</p>
